## Why ArrayList?
ArrayList is dynamic in size and easy to manage compared to arrays.

## Static Usage
Static ID generators are used to generate unique IDs.

## Inheritance
Person is a base class and Student extends it to reuse common fields.

## Separation of Concerns

- service → Business logic
- ui → User interaction
